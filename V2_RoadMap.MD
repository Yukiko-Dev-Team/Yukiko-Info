# Yukiko Bot RoadMap
This roadmap show what function we would like to add to the bot and/or are planed. Some may wont make it, if a version is added next to a function you can expect it for this version (You can know what version the bot is in via the `a!bot` commands.) if a function is maked with (**Canary**) it mean you can use it on our Canary version of Yukiko (found on the [release](https://yukiko.app/release) page of our [website](https://Yukiko.app))  
Remember: Yukiko is not our main priority, The Yukiko Dev Team is working on Yukiko on their own time, some of those function might take a long time before being deployed in production.
