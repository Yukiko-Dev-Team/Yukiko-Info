# Yukiko Website Rewrite

We're excited to announce that we're in the process of a big rewrite of Yukiko's websites! We're currently working on implementing all of the new and updated features that we have been working on. The current production website (V2) will remain functional until we officially roll out V3.

To give our users an idea of what we're working on, we've made a test version of V3 available to all Yukiko users to test as we build it. However, because we're constantly making updates and changes, some features may be missing, broken, or not working as expected.

In the future, we plan on having V3 be able to manage both Yukiko and Yukiko Canary, but this feature is still on the roadmap. For now, the V3 website will only change options for Yukiko (Production versions).

Additionally, many updates for the bot are also planned. These features will be reflected on the V3 website before V2.

Thank you for your patience and support as we continue to work on making Yukiko's websites and bot the best they can be!
